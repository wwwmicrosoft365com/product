<p><em>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 encountered an error during setup solved updated on Feb 2019</em></p>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>
<p>In most of the cases, the reason behind this office installation error is the system configuration between a 64-bit system and a 32-bit application and vice-versa.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Free Microsoft Office Subscription: You would possibly have noticed, Many laptops come with pre-setup software like antiviruses and equipment. You may not have observed but among the laptops and computers include loose Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p>Does now not depend on what version of Microsoft Office is unfastened with the computer or the device but it&#8217;s far nearly unfastened. Depending on the fact which you need to shop for a laptop and do a little study earlier than shopping for the laptop. Simple as that.</p>
<p>So we went out in the market and found some excellent laptops with terrific configurations and loose Windows 10 and Microsoft Office Pre-set up.</p>
<p>Some computer brands have been even completely promoting their laptops with Office pre-installed on it.</p>
<p>After we did a few studies in this pc marketplace we even located HP, Dell, and different foremost competitors had been also selling laptops with Office pre-hooked up on it.</p>
<p>But on a deeper survey, we determined that many shops have been promoting cracked Microsoft Office at the Free Dos version of Laptops and that they had already introduced the rate of the Office subscription on MRP.</p>
<p>To be sure on the way to discover a computer this is absolutely real and has a professional Office subscription you need to test for the logo of unique Microsoft Office Product on the front or the back facet of the laptop.</p>
<p>To verify your Office Subscription you may genuinely visit www.Office.Com/setup and confirm your Subscription via logging in for your Office Account.</p>
