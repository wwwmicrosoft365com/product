				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you open any website, the information related to that website gets stored in your computer in the form of a cookie. Cookies are the small files which contain information related to the website data. Moreover, it does store the website language, and location also gets stored in cookies. The browsers then stored such information and transfer this to the websites which allow the sites to offer data customized to meet your requirements. Cookies are capable of storing personal details such as addresses, contact numbers, etc. Therefore, to bolster your digital privacy, it is better to delete cookies from time to time.</p>
<p>Cache makes web pages to load faster when you open any website for the second time. For example, when you try to open a website with large-sized images and other media, then it will take a less time as compared to the first time when you open that website. Opera saves the content of the webpage on the device so that when you revisit the page, it does not take much time to load.</p>
<p>Opera is a critically-acclaimed web browsing software. It is available with multiple platforms such as Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, Blackberry, iOS, Android, etc. The beauty of this browser is its speed and efficient web browsing web experience, but sometimes users may notice unexpected behavior while trying to open websites as slowdown and browser hangs. While cache and cookies can be convenient, they can cause some problems with Opera. For example, web pages stop loading in the right fashion. In this blog, you will get the steps to clear cache and cookies in Opera.</p>
